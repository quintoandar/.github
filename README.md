This repository allows to create what GitHub calls as "health files" for organization level. So, here we can create ISSUE_TEMPLATE, PR_TEMPLATE, CODE_OF_CONDUCT and CONTRIBUTING files that is going to be used in all organization repos.

> Default files will be used for any public repository in your organization that does not contain its own file of that type.

Feel free to contribute! But remember to align because it is going to set as default for the entire GitHub organization.

:warning: **Also we are using this repo to serve the config file of our global organization actions. Please don't remove the `organization-workflows-settings.yml`**
