## Summary

TL;DR: A simple summary about the tech debt.

**Related feature:** Is it related to what major feature (e.g. visits, crm, contracts)?

<!--
Those below are going to be transformed into labels:

Age labels:

  - LEGACY: found in the codebase and being documented right now.

  - NEW_TECH_DEBT_INTRODUCED: we intentionally added a new tech debt in our codebase right now and we're documenting it.

Estimated cost labels:

  - SIMPLE: It's simple to identify the solution, fix it and test it.

  - COMPLEX: It's not so simple to understand it and fix it. It may also require big refactoring.

  - INVESTIGATION_NEEDED: There's a lot of unknowns, so that it's impossible to say until it's prioritized, investigated
                          and have proposed solutions.
